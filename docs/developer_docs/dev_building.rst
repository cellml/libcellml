==================
Building libCellML
==================

This document covers building libCellML from source.
It is assumed that you already have the codebase downloaded and ready for building.
The variable ``LIBCELLML_SRC`` shall be used to refer to the directory containing the ``LICENSE`` file for libCellML.

Build Directory
===============

It is best to build libCellML outside of the source tree.
To this end, create a build directory that is not the ``LIBCELLML_SRC`` directory.
A sibling directory of ``LIBCELLML_SRC`` is a good choice, named something like ``build`` or ``libcellml-build``.
The variable ``LIBCELLML_BUILD`` shall be used to refer to the build directory.

Configuration
=============

The libCellML library uses the `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`_ build configuration tool to configure the library.
Version 3.2 or greater of `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`_ is required to configure libCellML.

The configuration options for the library are detailed in the following table.
The command line options can be set with the ``-D`` flag, like so ``-DBUILD_TYPE=Release``.
Please note that in `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`_ GUI Configuration applications, the config variable is prefixed with ``LIBCELLML_``

.. include:: dev_configuration_options.rst

.. Select a generator that is appropriate for your system, or let the CMake configuration application

From the command line (bash shell), libCellML can be configured to create an optimised shared object library like so::

  cd $LIBCELLML_BUILD
  cmake -DBUILD_TYPE=Release $LIBCELLML_SRC

Windows
-------

When configuring libCellML on `Windows <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows>`_, we may need to set the location of the `LibXml2 <http://xmlsoft.org/>`_ library, which is dependent on the computer's environment settings.
We can set the location of the `LibXml2 <http://xmlsoft.org/>`_ library when we configure libCellML.
When we configure libCellML, the location of `LibXml2 <http://xmlsoft.org/>`_ can be specified through the command line by adding the parameter::

  -DLibXml2_DIR="C:\Program Files\libxml2 2.9.6\lib\cmake"

to the configuration command.
This assumes that the recommended `LibXml2 <http://xmlsoft.org/>`_ binaries have been installed to the default location ``C:\Program Files\libxml2 2.9.6``.
Please note that this method will only work with the recommended `LibXml2 <http://xmlsoft.org/>`_ binaries, `LibXml2 <http://xmlsoft.org/>`_ binaries from other sources will not work in this way.

Windows CMake-GUI
+++++++++++++++++

When we use the CMake-GUI application on `Windows <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows>`_, we first set the location of the source files and the location for the generated build files.
:numref:`fig_devBuilding_windowsCMakeGUISourceBuildDirs` shows the source files directory and the build directory set for user *andre*.

.. _fig_devBuilding_windowsCMakeGUISourceBuildDirs:

.. figure:: images/libCellMLBuilding-CMakeGUISourceBuildDirs.png
   :align: center
   :alt: CMake-GUI with initial values for source and build directories set.

   CMake-GUI with source and build directores set for user *andre*.

When we press the *Configure* button, `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`_ performs an initial configuration.
This initial configuration is likely to encounter an error because `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`_ is not able to find `LibXml2 <http://xmlsoft.org/>`_.
We can see in :numref:`fig_devBuilding_windowsCMakeConfigurationError` that this has happened for user *andre*.

.. _fig_devBuilding_windowsCMakeConfigurationError:

.. figure:: images/libCellMLBuilding-CMakeWindowsConfigurationError.png

We can resolve this error easily if we set the value of the ``LibXml2_DIR`` variable to the location of the `LibXml2 <http://xmlsoft.org/>`_ ``cmake`` directory.
:numref:`fig_devBuilding_windowsCMakeLibXml2DIRNotFound` shows the ``LibXml2_DIR`` variable with the value of ``LibXml2_DIR-NOTFOUND``.

.. _fig_devBuilding_windowsCMakeLibXml2DIRNotFound:

.. figure:: images/libCellMLBuilding-CMakeWindowsLibXml2DIRNotFound.png
   :align: center
   :alt: LibXml2_DIR variable with a value of LibXml2_DIR-NOTFOUND.

   ``LibXml2_DIR`` variable with a value of ``LibXml2_DIR-NOTFOUND``.

Setting the value of ``LibXml2_DIR`` to ``C:\Program Files\libxml2 2.9.6\lib\cmake`` and configuring again will result in a successful configuration (:numref:`fig_devBuilding_windowsCMakeLibXml2DirSet` shows a successfully configured ``LibXml2_DIR`` variable) from which build files may be generated using the *Generate* button.

.. _fig_devBuilding_windowsCMakeLibXml2DirSet:

.. figure:: images/libCellMLBuilding-CMakeWindowsLibXml2DirSet.png
   :align: center
   :alt: LibXml2_DIR variable with a value of C:\Program Files\libxml2 2.9.6\lib\cmake.

   ``LibXml2_DIR`` variable with a value of ``C:\Program Files\libxml2 2.9.6\lib\cmake``.

If `LibXml2 <http://xmlsoft.org/>`_ was not installed to ``C:\Program Files\libxml2 2.9.6``, you will need to adjust the path to match your situation.

Build
=====

Once the build scripts have been generated by `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`_, invoke the build with the appropriate command.
For ``Makefile``-based configurations, the command is simply::

  make

If testing is enabled, run the tests using the test target::

  make test

or using the `ctest <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html>`_ application::

  ctest

For a more verbose output, run::

  ctest -V
