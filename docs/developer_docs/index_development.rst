Documentation for developers
=================================

Welcome to the documentation of libCellML for contributors and developers.  If
you're looking for information on how to build the libCellML library from
source, how to set up a developmetn environment for contributions, and how
to get those contributions reviewed and integrated with the prime repository,
then you're in the right place.

If you'd like to just use the libCellML library within a simple installation,
please see the :ref:`Tutorial 0: Installation<tutorial0>` page instead.
