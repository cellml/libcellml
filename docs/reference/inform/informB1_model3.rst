    The encapsulation of a model defines the nested structure of its components.
    This in turn affects which variables have access to which other variables,
    and allows the modular behaviour to happen at any level.  For this reason,
    there can be only one :code:`encapsulation` item in any model.

    For more information about encapsulation, please refer to
    :ref:`The encapsulation element information item<spec_encapsulation>`.

    For more information and examples involving and explaining encapsulation,
    please refer to the
    :ref:`Theory of a sodium channel<_theory_sodiumchannel_interpretation>` page.
