    The only items which can be imported directly are :code:`component` and
    :code:`units` items.  The intention is that these are modular building
    blocks, able to be passed between models easily through this import
    functionality.

    When you import a :code:`component`, all its :code:`variables` and
    encapsulated child :code:`component` items are imported too,
    along with any its governing :code:`math` block and any :code:`units`
    items it uses.

    When you import a :code:`units` item, the child :code:`unit` items which
    it contain are imported as well.
