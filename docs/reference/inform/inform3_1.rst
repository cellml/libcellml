      Names and identifiers need to be a single word, and without any special
      characters other than an underscore.  For example, these are allowed:

        - :code:`myName`
        - :code:`my_name`
        - :code:`myName1`

      ... but these are not permitted:

        - :code:`my Name` has a space
        - :code:`myName!` contains a special character
        - :code:`1myName` starts with a numerical character

      Note that CellML identifiers are case-sensitive, and empty strings are not allowed.
