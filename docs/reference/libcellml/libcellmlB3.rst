    Using libCellML there are a couple of things to watch out for.  It
    will allow you import a :code:`Units` item which has a :code:`name`
    attribute that already exists in the importing model (as in this
    example), but will change the imported item's :code:`name` to avoid
    clashes.  The name will have an underscore :code:`_` added, followed
    by an unique integer.  The example would contain two :code:`Units`
    items called :code:`potOfPaint` (the locally defined one) and
    :code:`potOfPaint_1` (the imported one).

    Note that this does *not* imply that the units are equivalent, only
    that the name has been used before.  You can compare two :code:`Units`
    items using these functions:

    .. code-block:: cpp

      // This function will return "true" only when the two Units match exactly.  That is,
      // dimensionallyEquivalent(kilometre, thousand_metres) is true,
      // dimensionallyEquivalent(kilometre, metre) is false (scaling factor difference),
      // dimensionallyEquivalent(kilometre, apple) is false (base unit difference).
      static bool dimensionallyEquivalent(const UnitsPtr &units1, const UnitsPtr &units2);

      // This function will return "true" when the two Units base units match.  That is,
      // equivalent(kilometre, thousand_metres) is true,
      // equivalent(kilometre, metre) is true (scaling factor difference is ignored),
      // equivalent(kilometre, apple) is false (base unit difference).
      static bool equivalent(const UnitsPtr &units1, const UnitsPtr &units2);

      // This function simply returns the scaling factor between two Units
      // such that: units2 = units1*scalingFactor. where the base
      // units match.  Where they don't, it returns 0.
      // scalingFactor(metre, kilometre) returns 1000.0
      // scalingFactor(kilometre, apple) returns 0
      static double scalingFactor(const UnitsPtr &units1, const UnitsPtr &units2);

      **TODO** check with issue https://github.com/cellml/libcellml/issues/539 re naming of functions
