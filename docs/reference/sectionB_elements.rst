      :code:`component_2` attribute. The value of the :code:`component_2`
      attribute
      MUST be a :ref:`valid CellML identifier<specA_cellml_identifier>`.

      The value of this attribute MUST

The map_variables element
=========================

A :code:`map_variables` element information item (referred to in this
specification as a :code:`map_variables` element) is an element in the
:ref:`CellML namespace<specA_cellml_namespace>` with a local name equal to
:code:`map_variables`, and which appears as a child of a :code:`connection`
element.

Specific information items
--------------------------

.. container:: issue-map-variables-variable1

   1. Each :code:`map_variables` element MUST contain a
      :code:`variable_1` attribute.

      The value of the :code:`variable_1` attribute
      MUST be a :ref:`valid CellML identifier<specA_cellml_identifier>`.

      The value of this attribute MUST
      be equal to the :code:`name` attribute on a :code:`variable` element child
      of the :code:`component` element or :code:`import component` element
      referenced by the :code:`component_1` attribute on the :code:`connection`
      element which is the parent of this element.

.. container:: issue-map-variables-variable2

   2. Each :code:`map_variables` element MUST contain a
      :code:`variable_2` attribute.

      The value of the :code:`variable_2` attribute
      MUST be a :ref:`valid CellML identifier<specA_cellml_identifier>`.

      The value of this attribute MUST
      be equal to the :code:`name` attribute on a :code:`variable` element child
      of the :code:`component` element or :code:`import component` element
      referenced by the :code:`component_2` attribute on the :code:`connection`
      element which is the parent of this element.

.. container:: issue-map-variables-unique

   3. A :code:`connection` element MUST NOT contain more than one
      :code:`map_variables` element with a given :code:`variable_1` attribute
      value and :code:`variable_2` attribute value pair.
