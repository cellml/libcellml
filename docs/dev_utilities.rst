The utilities can be enabled through the configuration of the library.
In order to enable the utilities, set the configuration variable :code:`LIBCELLML_ENABLE_UTILITIES` to :code:`TRUE`.

The available utilities are:

#. Create MathML DTD files
#. Update generator profile SHA-1 values

Create MathML DTD files
=======================

The create MathML DTD files utility generates a compressed MathML DTD.
The MathML DTD is used to determine the validity of MathML strings in a CellML document.
This utility updates the header file :code:`mathmldtd.h` and source file :code:`mathmldtd.cpp` in the source tree of the current build.
For a make-based envirionment, the utility may be run with the following command::

  make create_mathml_dtd_files

Update generator profile SHA-1 values
=====================================

The update generator profile SHA-1 values utility calculates the SHA-1 values for the current C and Python generator profiles.
This utility updates the header file :code:`generatorprofilesha1values.h` in the source tree of the current build.
For a make-based envirionment, the utility may be run with the following command::

  make update_generator_profile_sha1_values
