Tutorial 2 Python: Debugging, error checking and validating
===========================================================

The outline for this tutorial is shown on the :ref:`Tutorial 2<tutorial2>` page.
These are the Python instructions.
For the same tutorial in C++ please see the :ref:`Tutorial 2 C++<tutorial2_cpp>` page instead.

**Requirements**

- :download:`tutorial2.py` The skeleton code or: download:`tutorial2_complete.py` the completed tutorial code;
- :download:`../resources/tutorial2.cellml` The input CellML file to read; and
- :download:`../utilities/tutorial_utilities.py` Utility functions for use in the tutorials.

Step 0: Setup
=============
For each of the tutorials, there is template code provided for you to get started in each of the :code:`tutorial*.py` files.

.. container:: dothis

    **Setup** Confirm that you're able to run the :code:`tutorial2.py` template against the libCellML library.
    To run the skeleton code, navigate into the :code:`tutorials` directory.
    To run the completed tutorial, navigate into the :code:`tutorials_completed` directory.

.. code::

    cd tutorials
    python tutorial2.py

This should give the output:

.. code-block:: console

        TUTORIAL 2: Debugging, error checking and validation
    ------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Create a ``Model`` from the contents of a CellML file
=============================================================

.. container:: dothis

    **1.a** As you did in :ref:`Tutorial 1<tutorial1_py>`, use the :code:`Parser` to create a model from the :code:`resources/tutorial2.cellml` file provided.

Instead of duplicating the work you did throughout the middle steps of :ref:`Tutorial 1<tutorial1_py>`, we've provided you with a set of utility functions in the :code:`tutorial_utilities.py` file which will help with some of the repeated bits of these tutorials.

.. container:: dothis

    **1.b** Use the utility function :code:`print_model_to_terminal(yourModelHere)` to output the contents of the model you just created to the terminal so that you can see it properly.
    You'll need to first include the utility functions using :code:`from tutorial_utilities import print_model_to_terminal`.

Step 2: Validate the parsed model
=================================
Within the libCellML library is the :code:`Validator` class.
This has one job - to make sure that what you give it is *valid* in terms of its CellML2.0 compliance.
Does it mean that your simulations will work the way you expect?
Nope, you can still write rubbish!
You can think of the validation being the spell-checker for your model.
It doesn't judge the meaning of *what* you've written, just the nitty-gritty of *how* you've written it.

The validator can also help you as you create and edit models by pointing out what's missing or incorrect as you go.
This is really easy:

.. code-block:: python

    validator = libCellML.Validator()
    validator->validateModel(yourModelHere)

.. container:: dothis

    **2.a** Create a :code:`Validator` and pass your model to it, as above.

When you've created a :code:`Validator` object and called it to check a model, a record of any errors is stored inside the validator.
To figure out what's going on, you need to retrieve the pointers to these :code:`Issue` objects.

As in :ref:`Tutorial 1<tutorial1_py>`, you can call a :code:`count` function (in the case of a :code:`Validator`, this is the :code:`errorCount()` function to determine whether any errors have been raised.

.. container:: dothis

    **2.b** Retrieve the number of errors from the validator, and print it to the terminal.

Now we need to create an iterative loop to retrieve all (and there should be a few in this particular model!) from the validator.
Again following the same retrieval idiom as in :ref:`Tutorial 1<tutorial1_py>` for items in sets, we can access the errors using an index:

.. code-block:: python

    the_fifteenth_rror = validator->error(14)

Inside an :code:`Issue` structure are two fields which are really useful.
These are the :code:`description()` (which does what you'd think) and the :code:`referenceHeading()`, which points you to the section in the CellML2.0 specification document for reference.

.. container:: dothis

    **2.c** Create a loop (up to the number of errors found in 2.b), retrieve each error, and print its description and specification reference to the screen.
    This is what we've used:

.. code-block:: python

    for e in range(0, number_of_validation_errors):
        # Retrieving the e-th error from the validator
        validator_error = validator->error(e)

        # Printing the description to the screen
        print("  Validator error[{e}]: ".format(e=e))
        print("     Description: " + validator_error.description())

        # Checking for a specification, and printing to the terminal if found
        specification_heading = validator_error.referenceHeading()
        if specification_heading != "":
            print("    See section {r} in the CellML specification.".format(
                r=specification_heading
                ))

Step 3: Fix the errors that were reported
=========================================
As you go through these tutorials you should be able to compile and run your code at any stage.
If you haven't been doing so already, then do it now, and take a look at what you've printed.
This section works through each of the errors found and shows you how to fix them.

.. code-block:: console

     Validator error[0]:
        Description: CellML identifiers must not begin with a European numeric character [0-9].
        See section 3.1.4 in the CellML specification.
     Validator error[1]:
        Description: Variable does not have a valid name attribute.
        See section 11.1.1.1 in the CellML specification.

These errors refer to the same thing, but are better read in reverse order.
Variables (and everything else in CellML which specifies a name attribute) must have the correct format.
Comparing the error to the names of entities printed in the terminal we can see that :code:`variable[0]` in :code:`component[0]` doesn't have a valid name (because it starts with a European numeric character).
Let's fix that.

Remembering from the last tutorial that we can access items through their indices, now we can use the :code:`setSomething(someValue)` idiom to fix the variable name:

.. code-block:: python

    # Access the 0th variable of the 0th component and set its name to "A".
    your_model_here.component(0).variable(0).setName("A")

.. container:: dothis

    **3.a** Add the fix above and check that it has indeed removed those errors from the list reported.

-----

On to the next error.

.. code-block:: console

     Validator error[2]:
        Description: Variable 'b' has an invalid units reference 'i_am_not_a_unit'
        that does not correspond with a standard unit or units in the variable's
        parent component or model.
        See section 11.1.1.2 in the CellML specification.

Variables must have units defined.
These can be either something from the built-in list within libCellML (which you can read in the specifications document), or something you define yourself.
We'll look at user defined units in :ref:`Tutorial 3<tutorial3_py>`, but for now it's enough to see that the units which are associated with variable :code:`b` are not valid.
We'll change it to be :code:`"dimensionless"` instead.

.. container:: gotcha

    **Remember** that items can be accessed through their name (as below) or their index (as above).

.. code-block:: python

    # Access the variable named "b" inside the "i_am_a_component" component
    # and set its units to be "dimensionless".
    your_model_here.component("i_am_a_component").variable("b").setUnits("dimensionless")

.. container:: dothis

    **3.b** Add the fix for this error and check that it's worked by running your code.

-----

.. code-block:: console

     Validator error[3]:
        Description: Variable 'c' has an invalid initial value
        'this_variable_doesnt_exist'. Initial values must be a real number
        string or a variable reference.
        See section 11.1.2.2 in the CellML specification.

We can either access members by their index or their name, as shown above, or we can create a pointer to them instead (as below).
Initial values (if set) must be a valid variable name in the same component, or a real number.

.. code-block:: python

    # Retrieve a pointer for the problem variable with a combo of names and index.
    variableC = your_model_here.component(0).variable("c")

    # Fix the initial value of the variable.  Note that this could also be a
    # variable name in the same component.
    variableC.setInitialValue(20.0)

.. container:: dothis

    **3.c** Add the fix for this error and check that it's worked by running your code.

-----

.. code-block:: console

     Validator error[4]:
        Description: CellML identifiers must contain one or more basic Latin
        :term:`alphabetic<Basic Latin alphabetic character>` characters.
        See section 3.1.3 in the CellML specification.
     Validator error[5]:
        Description: Variable 'd' does not have a valid units attribute.
        See section 11.1.1.2 in the CellML specification.


These two errors go together too.
Because we haven't defined a :code:`units` attribute for variable :code:`d`, it effectively has a blank name, which is not allowed.
Simply assigning units to the variable will fix both errors.

.. container:: dothis

    **3.d** You already know how to add units to a variable (as in step 3.a) so go ahead and fix this error any way you see fit.

-----

.. code-block:: console

    Description: MathML ci element has the child text 'a' which does not
        correspond with any variable names present in component
        'i_am_a_component' and is not a variable defined within a bvar element.


The maths block is complaining that it is being asked to compute :math:`a = b + c` but in the component there is no variable called :code:`"a"`.
Since we corrected - or tried to - this earlier by naming the first variable in the component :code:`"A"`, you need to go back and change it to lower-case instead.

.. container:: dothis

    **3.e** Fix up this last error, and check for yourself that your corrected model is now error-free.

Step 4: Have a look at the corrected model
==========================================
Let's have a look at our corrected model by calling that same utility function which we used earlier to print it to the screen.

.. container:: dothis

    **4.a** Print the model to the terminal again.

You should see something like this:

.. code-block:: console

        The model name is: 'tutorial_2_model'
        The model id is: 'tutorial 2 id has spaces'
        The model defines 0 custom units:
        The model has 1 components:
            Component[0] has name: 'i_am_a_component'
            Component[0] has id: 'my_component_id'
            Component[0] has 4 variables:
                Variable[0] has name: 'a'
                Variable[0] has units: 'dimensionless'
                Variable[1] has name: 'b'
                Variable[1] has units: 'dimensionless'
                Variable[2] has name: 'c'
                Variable[2] has initial_value: '20'
                Variable[2] has units: 'dimensionless'
                Variable[3] has name: 'd'
                Variable[3] has units: 'dimensionless'

.. container:: dothis

    **4.b** Use the Validator to check that the corrected model is now free of errors.

Step 5: Serialise and output the model to a file
================================================

.. container:: dothis

    **5.a** Just as you did in :ref:`Tutorial 1<tutorial1_py>`, create a :code:`Printer` and use it to serialise your model to a string.

.. container:: dothis

    **5.b** Finally, write your model string to a :code:`*.cellml` file.

.. container:: dothis

    **5.c** Go and have a cuppa, you're done!
