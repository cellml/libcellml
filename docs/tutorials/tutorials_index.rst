============================

These tutorials are designed so that you can choose to work through them in
sequence, and build on your code, or to jump in at any stage and use the
files provided.  Each tutorial is avaiable in both C++ and Python, and each
one comes with the full 'solutions' which should be able to run out of the box.
Click the links below to read the outline for each tutorial, access the
resources needed, and select which language to follow.

Tutorials 0-3 outline the basics of instalation and functionality.
