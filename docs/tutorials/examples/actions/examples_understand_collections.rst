Understand collections of items
===============================

Where an item can contain more than one child item (for example, more than one :code:`Variable` in a :code:`Component`, more than one :code:`Units` item in a :code:`Model`, etc) the processes for curating that collection follow the patterns outlined below.

**NB:** All of this explanation uses "thing" in place of the specific type of item (component, variable etc).

**NB:** This section explains the basic rationale of the collections.
For practical information about how they are used, please see the :ref:`Viewing a model<examples_view_model>` and :ref:`Editing a model<examples_edit_model>` pages.

    Count things

  Generic counting functions will return the number of child items using the :code:`thingCount()` function to get the number of :code:`thing` children.
  For example, :code:`unitsCount()` returns the number of :code:`Units` items in a :code:`Model`.
  This is useful when iterating through a collection or before using an index to access one of its members.

    Get a thing

  Pointers to items within a collection can be retrieved in two ways: by *getting* or by *taking*.
  The first does not affect the collection, and returns a pointer to the item: this is accomplished using the :code:`thing` function.

  There are two overloaded arguments for the get functionality:

  - :code:`thing(i)` returns a pointer to the thing at the i-th index position; and
  - :code:`thing("myThingName")` returns a pointer to the thing named "myThingName".

  Note that in this case the retrieval of the thing does not alter it, and neither does it alter the parent which owns it.

    Add a thing

  To add to a collection use the :code:`addThing` functionality.
  The basic form of adding is by symbol: :code:`addThing(thingToAdd)` which will append the pointer to :code:`thingToAdd` to the collection.
  Special cases of this are:

  - The :code:`addComponent` function will return a boolean variable telling you whether the operation was successful or not.
    In situations where the component has already been included in the collection, is present in another collection, or is not found, this operation will return false.
    Other add functions do not return any value.
  - The :code:`addUnit` function has many overloaded argument lists.
    Please refer to the full :api:`API addUnit<Units>` reference for details.

    Remove a thing

  To remove an item from the collection and detach its parent without returning a pointer to that item, use the :code:`removeThing` functions.

  .. container:: gotcha

    Because the collections are stored as a group of smart pointers, if no references exist to the item then its contents will also be deleted.
    If other references do exist, the parent pointer will be detached, but they won't otherwise be affected.

  .. container:: header-left

    Remove all the things

  In addition to the removal of specific items from a collection as above, you can also clear the entire collection using the :code:`removeAllThings` functions.

.. container:: toggle

  .. container:: header-left

    Take a thing

  The :code:`takeThing` functions combine a little of the *remove* and a little of the *get* functionality.
  It will return a pointer to the item (like the *get* :code:`thing` functionality above), but it will also remove the item from the collection (like :code:`removeThing`), updating both the collection as well as the item's parent.
  The item is thus detached from its parent, and "taken" by the returned pointer.

  Examples are shown for C++ and Python below.

        // Consider the case where we already have a model containing a component named "myComponent" at index 0.

        // Case 1: Use the get and remove functionality together.
        auto component = model->component(0);               // Get either by index,
        auto component = model->component("componentName"); // or by name.

        bool componentWasRemoved = model->removeComponent(0);               // Remove either by index,
        bool componentWasRemoved = model->removeComponent("componentName"); // by name,
        bool componentWasRemoved = model->removeComponent(component);       // or by symbol.

        // At this point, the model's components collection no longer contains the component, and the component
        // pointer has no parent.

        // Case 2: Use the take functionality.
        auto component = model->takeComponent(0);             // Take either by index,
        auto component = model->takeComponent("myComponent"); // or by name.

        // At this point, we have the same outcome as in Case 1 above.  The model's component collection no
        // longer contains the component, and the component itself has no parent.

        // Case 3: A cautionary tale using remove without get.
        auto iAmABooleanNotAComponent = model->removeComponent(0); // Remove either by index, name or symbol as above.

        // In the situation where no other reference to the component exists (ie: we did not "get" it as in Case 1),
        // the model's collection will no longer contain the component AND the entire contents of that component

    Replace a thing

  Within the :code:`Model` and :code:`Component` items are :code:`replaceUnits` and :code:`replaceComponent` functions respectively.
  Their operation is straightforward: a position within the collection is specified (either using an index, or the name of an existing item in the collection), and a replacement item is supplied.
  The replacement item overwrites what was previously stored at the position in the collection.
  In addition, the :code:`replaceComponent` takes an optional boolean argument indicating whether to search the encapsulated children for the item, if specified by name.
  By default this is set to :code:`true`.
  For more information about replacement, please see the API documentation for :api:`Model<Model>` and :api:`Component<Component>` items directly.

  .. container:: gotcha

      Note that these **only** operate on collections of items; that is, the collections of :code:`Units` and :code:`Component` items in a :code:`Model`, and encapsulated child :code:`Component` items in a parent :code:`Component`.
