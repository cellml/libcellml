    Set automatic ids throughout the model

  For times when you don't want to manually set id attributes through the model, you can use the :code:`Printer` to do it for you.
  When serialising a model using the :code:`printModel` function, the optional second argument is a boolean switch indicating whether or not to assign automatic :code:`id` attributes to any items which don't already have one.
  Existing :code:`id` attributes are unchanged by this process, and by default it is turned off.

  The automatic ids adhere to the :cellml2:`XML standard for id attributes<reference/formal_and_informative/specA2.html#xml-id-attributes>`, and take the form of a 6-digit hexadecimal number, beginning with a letter.

      auto parser = libcellml::Parser::create();

      // use the option to create automatic ids.
      auto printer = libcellml::Printer::create();
      auto outString = printer->printModel(model, true);

      // The outString will have the same model contents, but with id attributes set throughout.
