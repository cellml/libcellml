Tutorial 3: Creating a model using the API
==========================================

By the time you have worked through Tutorial 3 you will be able to:

- create a new model and its child entities from scratch using the API
- write your own MathML syntax to construct governing equations
- define custom combinations of built-in units
- define your own custom units independent from the built-in units
- use the :code:`Generator` functionality to transform the model into other
  languages.

This tutorial assumes that you are comfortable with:

- accessing and adjusting names of items inside a model hierarchy
  (see :ref:`Tutorial 2<tutorial2>`)
- creating a validator and using it to check a model for errors
  (see :ref:`Tutorial 2<tutorial2>`)
- accessing the errors produced by a validator and using them to correct
  the model (see :ref:`Tutorial 2<tutorial2>`)
- serialising and printing a model to a CellML2 file (see
  :ref:`Tutorial 1<tutorial1>`)

--------
Overview
--------

During this tutorial you will create a simple model representing the
exponential decay of speed for a sled sliding on ice.  You will use
both built-in and create your own user-defined units.

-------------
Step 0: Setup
-------------

For each of the tutorials, there is template code provided for you to get
started in each of the :code:`tutorial*.py` files.

.. container:: dothis

    **Setup** Confirm that you're able to run the :code:`tutorial3.py`
    template against the libCellML library.  To run the skeleton code,
    navigate into the :code:`tutorials` directory.  To run the completed
    tutorial, navigate into the :code:`tutorials_completed` directory.

.. code::

    cd tutorials
    python tutorial3.py

This should give the output:

.. container:: terminal

    | -----------------------------------------------
    |   TUTORIAL 3: CREATE A MODEL USING THE API
    | -----------------------------------------------
    |

---------------------------------
1: Set up the governing equations
---------------------------------

Just as you did in :ref:`Tutorial 2<tutorial2>`, we need to start by setting
up a :code:`Model` model instance, and creating a component inside it.

.. container:: dothis

    **1.a**
    Create a new :code:`Model` instance.
    Set the name and id attributes of the model you created, and print them to
    the terminal to check them.

.. container:: dothis

    **1.b**
    Create a new :code:`Component` instance.  Name it and add it
    to the model you created above.

Now for the real bit.  In order to actually model anything, we need to include
some mathematical equations which represent the phyiscal situation of interest.
As you saw in :ref:`Tutorial 2<tutorial2>`, the maths and the
:code:`Variable` items which it references live inside a parent
:code:`Component` item.  At this point it should be noted that the order in
which you add your components, or models, or variables (or anything) is not
important to the final product, but it *can* affect how quickly you're able to
find and fix bugs along the way.  In these tutorials, we have suggested that
you add the mathematics first and use a :code:`Validator` to notify you of the
outstanding items, but you can really do this in any order you choose.

The governing equation describes the motion of the sled as a
function of time, as shown below: TODO finish description

.. math::

    \frac{dx}{dt}=ax+b

where :math:`x` is the sled's position, :math:`t` is time, and :math:`a` an
:math:`b` are constants representing the time constant and initial conditions.
In order to use this in our model we need to write it as a
MathML2 string.  The basic structure for these is described in the
:mathml2:`W3 resource pages regarding MathML2 <>`.

.. container:: nb

    **Note** that libCellML will **only** accept MathML2 markup, even though
    later versions (3 and 4) are now available.

Looking at the right hand side first, the MathML2 representation of
:math:`ax+b` is

.. code-block:: xml

                <apply><plus/>
                    <apply><times/>
                        <ci>a</ci>
                        <ci>x</ci>
                    </apply>
                    <ci>b</ci>
                </apply>

Three things can be seen here:

- the :code:`<apply>` opening and :code:`</apply>` closing tags which surround
  the *operations*,
- the *operations* tags like :code:`<times/>` and :code:`<plus/>` which stand
  alone rather than in an open/close pair,
- the :code:`<ci>` opening and :code:`</ci>` closing tags which surround the
  variable names.

The left-hand side, :math:`\frac{dx}{dt}` becomes:

.. code-block:: xml

                <apply><diff/>
                    <bvar>
                        <ci>t</ci>
                    </bvar>
                    <ci>x</ci>
                </apply>

Two further items to note:

- the base variable for the integration identified by the
  :code:`<bvar> ... </bvar>` tags,
- the :code:`<diff/>` operation signifying differentiation with respect to the
  base variable.

When both sides are defined we need to equate them by :code:`<apply>` -ing the
:code:`<eq/>` equals operator, and create a string so that we end up with:

.. code-block:: python

    equation = '<apply><eq/>\
                    <apply><diff/>\
                        <bvar>\
                            <ci>t</ci>\
                        </bvar>\
                        <ci>x</ci>\
                    </apply>\
                    <apply><plus/>\
                        <apply><times/>\
                            <ci>a</ci>\
                            <ci>x</ci>\
                        </apply>\
                        <ci>b</ci>\
                    </apply>\
                </apply>'

.. container:: dothis

    **1.c**
    Copy the string above into your code.  We will complete the inclusion of the
    maths in the next step.

Next you need to define the namespace in which the maths will be applied
by enclosing it in the :code:`<math> ... </math>` tags with the two namespaces:

- the XML namespace :code:`xmlns` at http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML
- the CellML2 namespace :code:`xmlns:cellml` at http://www.cellml.org/cellml/2.0#

It's simple to do this once in your code using a string to represent the
opening attributes and namespaces; this string can be reused easily
throughout your code as needed later:

.. code-block:: python

    math_header = '<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:cellml="http://www.cellml.org/cellml/2.0#">'
    math_footer = '</math>'

.. container:: dothis

    **1.d**
    Copy the opening and closing math strings above into your code.

Our last step in defining the mathematics is to link it into the component. The
functions available to manipulate maths are:

- a :code:`setMath` function, which overwrites any existing MathML strings
  stored in the :code:`Component` item.
- an :code:`appendMath` function, which performs a straightforward string
  concatenation with the current contents of the maths string in the
  :code:`Component`.
- note that you can use the a :code:`setMath('')` function with an argument of
  an empty string to remove all maths contents if need be.

.. container:: dothis

    **1.e**
    Use the functions above to include the :code:`math_header`,
    :code:`equation`, and :code:`math_footer` strings into your component.
    Note that the order in which these are added *is* important, as they are
    stored as a single concatenated string.

.. container:: dothis

    **1.f**
    Create a :code:`Validator` instance and use it to check for errors in the
    model at this point.  Use the utility function
    :code:`print_errors_to_terminal(validator)` to output the messages to the
    terminal.

You should see an output similar to that shown below:

.. container:: terminal

    | The validator has found 5 errors!
    | Validator error[0]:
    |    Description: MathML ci element has the child text 't' which does not correspond with any variable names present in component 'distance_finder'.
    | Validator error[1]:
    |    Description: MathML ci element has the child text 'x' which does not correspond with any variable names present in component 'distance_finder'.
    | Validator error[2]:
    |    Description: MathML ci element has the child text 'a' which does not correspond with any variable names present in component 'distance_finder'.
    | Validator error[3]:
    |    Description: MathML ci element has the child text 'x' which does not correspond with any variable names present in component 'distance_finder'.
    | Validator error[4]:
    |    Description: MathML ci element has the child text 'b' which does not correspond with any variable names present in component 'distance_finder'.
    |

Running the validator will alert you variables in the MathML that don't (yet)
exist in your component.  This was explained in :ref:`Tutorial 2<tutorial2>`.

.. container:: dothis

    **1.g** Create :code:`Variable` instances for each of the missing
    variables discovered above.  Remember that:

    - you will need to give each a name using the :code:`setName` function,
      where the name must match that inside your MathML string.
    - you will need to add each variable to the component using the
      :code:`addVariable` function.

At this stage you'll realise that you haven't yet added the :code:`Units` for
any of the variables.  Roll on Step 2 ...

--------------------------------
2: Built-in and customised units
--------------------------------

Linking variables to the *name* of their units is straightforward, but in
order to be able to use them we need to also define what the name actually
*means* by creating the units themselves.  Some basic units have been defined
and built into libCellML, others you can define by combining the built-in
ones using scaling factors and exponents, or you can define your own from
scratch if need be.  There are four different kinds of units used here.

Irreducible units
-----------------
The first kind is called *irreducible* because it represents the physical
base quantities which cannot be further simplified:

- length (:code:`metre`)
- time (:code:`second`)
- amount of a substance (:code:`mole`)
- temperature (:code:`kelvin`)
- mass (:code:`kilogram`)
- current (:code:`ampere`)
- luminous intensity (:code:`candela`)
- non-dimensional (:code:`dimensionless`)

These *irreducible* units can be used to create all other physically-based
units by combining them using different exponents, multipliers, and prefixes.

Built-in units
--------------
Some of these combinations form our second type of units, the *built-in units*,
these being common relationships which have been constructed from combinations
of the irreducible units.  The combinations can involve:

- a scaling factor (the units :code:`millisecond` is equivalent to
  :code:`second` and a factor of 0.001)
- a combination of units (a :code:`coulomb` is a :code:`second` multiplied by
  an :code:`ampere`)
- powers of units (a :code:`Hertz` has a base of :code:`second` with an
  exponent of -1)
- any combination of the above.

A list of pre-existing *built-in* convenience units is shown in the
:ref:`Built-in Units page<builtinunits>`, along with
their relationships to the irreducible units.

Compound units
--------------
The third type of units are those *combinations* which users can define for
themselves based on the built-in units, the irreducible units, any other units
already created, or (see below) their own custom irreducible units.

For example, let's say that you want to simulate the time variable,
:math:`t`, in units of milliseconds.  This isn't one of the built-in units, so
you'll need to define it, but it's easy to see that it's based on the built-in
:code:`second`, but needs a scaling factor.

For convenience libCellML gives a variety of options for defining such scaling
factors:

- | either through the use of named prefixes which are listed on the
   :ref:`Prefix page<prefixes>`:
  |    eg: :code:`millisecond` is :code:`second` with :code:`prefix="milli"`
- | by defining an integer or integer string as a prefix which represents the
    :math:`log_{10}` of the scaling factor:
  |    eg: :code:`millisecond` is :code:`second` with :code:`prefix=-3`
   gives a scaling factor of :math:`10^{-3}=0.001`
  |    NB: using an integer string like :code:`prefix="-3"` gives the same
   result
- | by defining the scaling factor directly, as a multiplier:
  |    eg: :code:`millisecond` is :code:`second` with :code:`multiplier=0.001`


The overloaded argument option list is shown below:

.. code-block:: python

    addUnit(reference,          # the name of the Unit to add as a string
            prefix,             # the built-in prefix as a string, or an integer (see below)
            exponent = 1.0,     # the exponent as a float (optional)
            multiplier = 1.0,   # the multiplier as a float (optional)
            id = ""             # the id of the Unit as a string (optional)
            )

    addUnit(reference,          # the name of the Unit to add as a string
            exponent = 1.0,     # the exponent as a float (optional)
            id = ""             # the id of the Unit as a string (optional)
            )

    addUnit(reference,          # the name of the Unit to add as a string
            )


The creation of the :code:`millisecond` unit you need will
follow the same basic steps as other entities: declare it, name it, define
it, and then add it in.  For example:

.. code-block:: python

    # Declaring, naming, and defining the "millisecond" unit pointer
    ms = libcellml.Units()
    ms.setName("millisecond")

    # The manner of specification here is agnostic: all three definitions are identical.
    ms.addUnit("second", "milli")  # reference unit and built-in prefix
    # OR
    ms.addUnit("second", 1.0, -3)  # reference unit, multiplier, exponent
    # OR
    ms.addUnit("second", 1.0, 0, 0.001)  # reference unit, multiplier, exponent


.. container:: dothis

    **2.a** Use the example above to create, name and define two units:
    milliseconds and leagues (a league is 5556 metres).

.. container:: nb

    **Note:**

    - When you add different sub-unit parts into a :code:`Units` item, the function
      is :code:`addUnit` (singular), and it takes as argument the *name* of the
      sub-unit as a string (eg: :code:`"second"` used above)
    - When you add the final created combination into the :code:`Model` item,
      the function is :code:`addUnits` (plural), and it takes as argument the
      *reference* of the combined units (eg: :code:`ms` used below)

.. container:: dothis

    **2.b** Add the units which you've just created into your model, as
    in the example below.

.. code-block:: python

    # Add the millisecond unit to the model
    model.addUnits(ms)

Units can be defined based on one another as well.  For example, after defining
our :code:`millisecond` units, we could then use this definition to define the
:code:`per_millisecond` units by simply including it with an exponent of -1:

.. code-block:: python

    # Defining a per_millisecond unit based on millisecond^-1
    per_ms.addUnit(ms, -1.0)

This will be useful later in :ref:`Tutorial 4<tutorial4>`.

Custom irreducible units
------------------------
For completeness, the final type of unit is a custom irreducible unit.
While this is not common (all of the seven physical attriubutes are already
included), for those rare occasions where you might need to model something
not physically based, you're able to define your own.  Here's an example.

.. code-block:: python

    # Create a custom irreducible unit named "banana"
    u1 = libcellml.Units()
    u1.setName("banana")

    # Note that when a Units item is defined with a name only, it is effectively
    # irreducible because we don't know how to deal with it!

    # Create a new compound unit based on the "banana" unit above
    u2 = libcellml.Units()
    u2.setName("bunch_of_bananas")
    u2.addUnit("banana", 5.0)      # include bananas^5 in the bunch_of_bananas unit

.. container:: dothis

    **2.c** Now that you've created the units for each of your variables,
    call the validator to check your model for errors.  You should see an
    output similar to that shown below.

.. container:: terminal

    | The validator has found 2 errors!
    |   Validator error[0]:
    | Description: MathML ci element has the child text 'a' which does not correspond with any variable names present in component 'distance_finder'.
    |   Validator error[1]:
    | Description: MathML ci element has the child text 'b' which does not correspond with any variable names present in component 'distance_finder'.
    |

These are referring to the two constants :math:`a` and :math:`b` that were
included in the MathML block which have not yet been defined.  At this point
there are two options:

- include the constants as real numbers within the MathML string directly, or
- create them as variables as above, defining their names, units and values.

We'll do one of each to demonstrate the process.

Because the dimensionality of the equation needs to be valid, all constants
must be associated with units.  These are defined within the tags, and must
also refer to the :code:`cellml` namespace:

.. code-block:: xml

    <cn cellml:units="bunch_of_bananas">1</cn>

... which gives us one bunch of bananas, without needing to create a
corresponding :code:`Variable` item.  Of course, you may need to create the
corresponding :code:`Units` item and add it to the model, if not already
present.

.. container:: dothis

    **2.d**  Create a copy of the MathML statement from step 1.c and change
    the value of :math:`b` to be a value of 2.0. You will
    need to deduce the appropriate units and include them in the MathML too.
    Recall that using the :code:`setMath()` function will overwrite the
    existing maths, and repeat the process you did in step 1.e to
    include the new MathML instead.  Remember that you will need to reinclude
    the opening and closing :code:`<math>` tags too.  Call the validator to
    check that the error related to :math:`b` has gone.

.. container:: dothis

    **2.e**  At this stage you should have just one validation error remaining.
    Since you already know how to create and add variables, go ahead and make
    one which represents :math:`a` in the governing equation.  Use the
    :code:`setInitialValue` function to set its value to :math:`-1.0`.  Note
    that even though you're not going to change its value during the solution
    process, this is the only way in which the value of any variable can be set
    directly.  Check that the model is now free of validation errors.


3: Use code generation to change the output langauge
----------------------------------------------------

Some exciting new functionality of libCellML is its ability to generate a
runable file from a model description.  This means that if you already have
a solver in either C or Python, you can simply translate your model from here
into that language.  Let's give it a go.

The generator is instantiated in the same way as the other items:

.. code-block:: python

    # Instantiate the generator and submit the model to it for processing
    libcellml::Generator generator;
    generator.processModel(model);

.. container:: dothis

    **3.a**  Create a :code:`Generator` instance and follow the example above
    to process your model.  Call the utility function
    :code:`print_errors_to_terminal` with your generator as an argument
    to list its errors.  You should see an output similar to that shown below.

.. container:: terminal

    | The generator has found 1 errors!
    |   Generator error[0]:
    | Description: Variable 'x' in component 'distance_finder' of model
      'tutorial_3_model' is used in an ODE, but it is not initialised.
    |

The error message above refers to the fact that though we've set the value of
the constant :math:`a`, we haven't constrained the model with sufficient
initial conditions.

.. container:: dothis

    **3.b** Set the initial value such that :math:`x(t=0)=5` and re-process
    the model. You should see no errors now.

The :code:`Generator` has to re-interpret all of the maths, including the
variables, their interaction with each other in different equations, values,
initial conditions and units before it can output your model in your choice
of language.  For the maths to make sense, the definitions in your model's
variables, maths blocks and units need to be solvable too.  There are several
requirements that need to be satisfied in order for the code generation
functionality to be able to work.  These are:

- the mathematical model definition must be appropriately constrained (not
  over- or under-constrained)
- initial conditions must be specified for variables which are integrated
- initial conditions must not be specified for variables which are the base of
  integration
- **TODO get full list of stuff here ...**

Parameters can be investigated using the same format of functions as
elsewhere:

- The :code:`voi()` function returns a *pointer* to the :code:`Variable` which
  is to be used as the variable of integration (VOI).  This is specified inside
  the MathML block using the :code:`<bvar>...</bvar>` tags.
  To return its *name* you can use :code:`your_generator.voi().name()`.

- The :code:`variableCount()` function returns the number of variables which
  need to be solved for in the model.  As with elsewhere, you can access the
  variable at index :code:`i` using the :code:`variable(i)` function.  Note
  that this does *not* include:

  - :code:`Variable` items which are actually constants (as in the :math:`a`
    variable in your model)
  - :code:`Variable` items which are used as the base for integration.

- The :code:`stateCount()` function returns number of states in the model.
  In this context states are ... **??? TODO ??**

When the generator processes your model it will determine the model's type,
this being one of the following:

        - :code:`UNKNOWN` where ...
        - :code:`ALGEBRAIC` No integration is needed
        - :code:`ODE` One or more ordinary differential equations to solve
        - :code:`INVALID` Computer says no **TODO**
        - :code:`UNDERCONSTRAINED` Computer still says no
        - :code:`OVERCONSTRAINED` Computer says no AGAIN
        - :code:`UNSUITABLY_CONSTRAINED` OMG computer, what do you want from me

The :code:`modelType()` function returns the classification as an :code:`enum`,
so you'll need to interpret it by comparing to the enum list above.  In the
tutorials you're given a utility function that will return the name of the enum
for you, eg: :code:`getModelTypeFromEnum(generator.modelType())`. TODO

The Generator functionality refers to its different language options
as *profiles*.  The default setting is for C, but you can change this using the
:code:`setProfile` function to switch to Python:

.. code-block:: python

    # Change the generated language from the default C to Python
    profile = libcellml.GeneratorProfile(libcellml.GeneratorProfile.Profile.PYTHON)
    generator.setProfile(profile)

TODO Check whether the use of the copy constructor is actually needed??

.. container:: dothis

    **3.d** Change the generator profile to Python.

Of course, your choice of generator profile (language) will affect
*what* you need to export:

- If you're using C, then you will need both the header file as well as the
  source code.
- If you're using Python, you will only need the source code.

For code generation into Python:

.. code-block:: python

    # Retrieve the main script code only
    source_code = generator.implementationCode()

For code generation into C:

.. code-block:: python

    # Retrieve the interface or header code, and write to a file:
    header_code = generator.interfaceCode()

    # Retrieve the main source code and write to a file:
    source_code = generator.implementationCode()

.. container:: dothis

    **3.e** Use the examples above to create your own source code from your
    model, and save it into an appropriately named file.

**TODO** **Need to write about the running code here**

.. container:: dothis

    **3.e**
    Go and have a cuppa, you're done!
