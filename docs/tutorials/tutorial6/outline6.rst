Tutorial 6: Working with multiple components
============================================

Getting started:  If you're reading this it's presumed that you're already comfortable with the serlialisation, manipulation, and debugging functionality available in the libCellML library, as well as using the API to create, debug and validate your model.
This tutorial will build on work done in :ref:`Tutorial 5<tutorial5>`: if you are starting from here you can find the files which were created in that tutorial in the :code:`resources` folder.

By the end of this tutorial you will be able to:

- Create a CellML2.0 model which includes encapsulations and more than one :code:`Component`; and
- Connect :code:`Components` to one another by mapping equivalent :code:`Variables`.

Overview
--------
In :ref:`Tutorial 5<tutorial5>` we created a component representing an ion channel.
The channel is controlled by a number of gates in series, whose open or closed state and the transition between them is controlled by voltage: hence, a "voltage-controlled ion gate".
In this tutorial we will explore how a channel such as that made in Tutorial 5 can include another level of control: the rate constants (:math:`\alpha_n` and :math:`\beta_n`) used earlier are now functions of voltage themselves.
This is the situation in a potassium channel, the theory of which is described in :ref:`A model of a potassium channel<theory_potassiumchannel>`.

We will also show how an *environment* or *boundary conditions* component can be used to ensure that the independent variables in the model are shared consistently between components.
Storing the initial and independent variables in an external component also makes it easier to change them without needing to edit the model proper.

C++ instructions
----------------
Please see the :ref:`C++ instructions<tutorial6_cpp>` page.
You will need to download these resources:

    - :download:`CMakeLists.txt` The CMake file for building this tutorial;
    - :download:`tutorial6.cpp` Either the skeleton code, or :download:`tutorial6_complete.cpp` the completed tutorial code; and
    - :download:`../utilities/tutorial_utilities.h` and :download:`../utilities/tutorial_utilities.cpp`  Utility functions for
      use in the tutorials.
    - If you did not complete Tutorial 5 you can download the file created there from: :download:`../resources/tutorial5_IonChannelModel.cellml`

Python instructions
-------------------
Please see the :ref:`Python instructions<tutorial6_py>` page.
You will need to download these resources:

    - :download:`tutorial6.py` Either the skeleton code, or :download:`tutorial6_complete.py` the completed tutorial code; and
    - :download:`../utilities/tutorial_utilities.py`  Utility functions for use in the tutorials.
    - If you did not complete Tutorial 5 you can download the file created there from: :download:`../resources/tutorial5_IonChannelModel.cellml`
