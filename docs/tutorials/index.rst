libCellML Tutorials - Theory and References
===========================================

The first set of files details the theoretical backgrounds - chemical,
biological, and mathematical - behind the modelling example used in these
tutorials. As
you work through the modelling section in Tutorials 4-8 you'll be creating
a CellML model representing Hodgkin and Huxley's neuron model, as explained
below.

The second section includes general reference information which is used
thoughout libCellML, including the built-in units, prefixes, and external
references.
