/**
 *      TUTORIAL 5: IMPORTS, COMPONENTS, AND CONNECTIONS
 * 
 *  This tutorial explores the ability of CellML to represent more than one
 *  modelled process at a time using components with connections between them.
 *  By the time you have worked through Tutorial 5 you will be able to:
 *      - import a Component or Units item from an existing CellML file
 *      - assemble a multi-component model using the API
 *      - inter-connect the components using the equivalent variables 
 *        functionality
 *      - validate and debug the constructed model
 * 
 *  Tutorial 5 assumes that you are already comfortable with:
 *      - file manipulation and summarising using the utility functions
 *      - model creation through the API
 *      - debugging the model using the Validator functionality

    //  1.a Read the model created in Tutorial 4.  Note that if you didn't
    //      do that tutorial you can simply copy the CellML file
    //      from resources/tutorial4_IonChannelModel.cellml


    //  1.b Print the parsed model to the terminal and check its contents

    //  1.c Create a Validator and use it to check that the model is ok so far
    //      by printing the errors to the terminal

    //  1.d Retrieve and rename the component

    //  2.a Creating the new environment component

    //  2.b Add variables to the component.  Use { } brackets to define the scope of
    //      these variables. This means that we can use variables with the same
    //      symbol elsewhere.
    {

    //  3.a Creating the n-gate component and the variables it contains

    //  3.c Add the n-gate component into the model.

    //  3.d Add the missing units (connected to the constant in equation 1) and recheck the validation

    std::cout << "-----------------------------------------------" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "  STEP 4: Define the component hierarchy " << std::endl;
    std::cout << "-----------------------------------------------" << std::endl;

    //  4.a Change the nGate component to be a child of the potassiumChannel component

    //  4.b Verify the component hierarchy by printing the model to the screen

    //  4.c Define the equivalent variables between components.  Note that because
    //      the variables have been defined within a limited scope (using the {} above)
    //      you will need to retrieve them from each component first.

    //  4.d Validating the model: this should show an error reporting that an
    //      invalid connection has been made between the environment and nGate
    //      components

    //  4.e  Fix the connection error above, and add the voltage and gating variable equivalences

    //  4.f Add the interface specification.  The environment component is a sibling of the potassiumChannel
    //      component, so they will both use the public interface.  The nGate component is a child of the
    //      potassiumChannel, so will use the public interface.  The potassiumChannel is the parent of the
    //      nGate component, so will need an additional private interface.  The nGate will have a public
    //      interface to its parent, the potassiumChannel.  Thus for the V and t variables:
    //          - environment -> public
    //          - potassiumChannel -> public_and_private
    //          - nGate -> public
    //      Because the n variable is shared only between the potassiumChannel and the nGate, we don't need to
    //      use the public_and_private designation there; just private on the parent and public on the child.
