==================
Building libCellML
==================

This document covers building libCellML from source.  It is assumed that you already have the codebase downloaded and ready for building.  The variable ``LIBCELLML_SRC`` shall be used to refer to the directory containing the ``LICENSE`` file for libCellML.

Build Directory
===============

It is best to build libCellML outside of the source tree.  To this end create a build directory that is not the ``LIBCELLML_SRC`` directory.  A sibling directory of ``LIBCELLML_SRC`` is a good choice, named something like; ``build`` or ``libcellml-build``.  The variable ``LIBCELLML_BUILD`` shall be used to refer to the build directory.

Configuration
=============

The libCellML library uses the CMake build configuration tool to configure the library.  Version 3.2 or greater of CMake is required to configure libCellML.  Download and installation instructions are available from `CMake <http://www.cmake.org/>`_.

The configuration options for the library are detailed in the following table.  The command line options can be set with the ``-D`` flag, like so ``-DBUILD_TYPE=Release``.  Please note that in CMake GUI Configuration applications the config variable is prefixed with ``LIBCELLML_``

.. include:: dev_configuration_options.rst

.. Select a generator that is appropriate for your system, or let the CMake configuration application

From the command line (bash shell) libCellML can be configured to create an optimised shared object library like so::

   cd $LIBCELLML_BUILD
   cmake -DBUILD_TYPE=Release $LIBCELLML_SRC

Windows
-------

When configuring libCellML on Windows, we may need to set the location of the LibXml2 library, which is dependent on the computer's environment settings.  We can set the location of the LibXml2 library when we configure libCellML.  When we configure libCellML, the location of LibXml2 can be specified through the command line by adding the parameter::

   -DLibXml2_DIR="C:/Program Files/libxml2 2.9.6/lib/cmake"

to the configuration command.  This assumes that the recommended LibXml2 binaries have been installed to the default location *C:\Program Files\libxml2 2.9.6*.  Please note that this method will only work with the recommended LibXml2 binaries, LibXml2 binaries from other sources will not work in this way.

Windows CMake-GUI
+++++++++++++++++

When we use the CMake-GUI application on Windows, we first set the location of the source files and the location for the generated build files. :numref:`fig_devBuilding_windowsCMakeGUISourceBuildDirs` shows the source files directory and the build directory set for user *andre*.

.. _fig_devBuilding_windowsCMakeGUISourceBuildDirs:

   :align: center
   :alt: CMake-GUI with initial values for source and build directories set.

When we press the *Configure* button CMake performs an initial configuration.  This initial configuration is likely to encounter an error because CMake is not able to find LibXml2.  We can see in :numref:`fig_devBuilding_windowsCMakeConfigurationError` that this has happened for user *andre*.

We can resolve this error easily if we set the value of the *LibXml2_DIR* variable to the location of the LibXml2 *cmake* directory. :numref:`fig_devBuilding_windowsCMakeLibXml2DIRNotFound` shows the *LibXml2_DIR* variable with the value of *LibXml2_DIR-NOTFOUND*.

.. _fig_devBuilding_windowsCMakeLibXml2DIRNotFound:

.. figure:: images/libCellMLBuilding-CMakeWindowsLibXml2DIRNotFound.png
   :align: center
   :alt: LibXml2_DIR variable with a value of LibXml2_DIR-NOTFOUND.

   LibXml2_DIR variable with a value of LibXml2_DIR-NOTFOUND.

Setting the value of *LibXml2_DIR* to *C:/Program Files/libxml2 2.9.6/lib/cmake* and configuring again will result in a successful configuration (:numref:`fig_devBuilding_windowsCMakeLibXml2DirSet` shows a successfully configured LibXml2_DIR variable) from which build files may be generated using the *Generate* button.

.. _fig_devBuilding_windowsCMakeLibXml2DirSet:

.. figure:: images/libCellMLBuilding-CMakeWindowsLibXml2DirSet.png
   :align: center
   :alt: LibXml2_DIR variable with a value of *C:/Program Files/libxml2 2.9.6/lib/cmake*.

   LibXml2_DIR variable with a value of *C:/Program Files/libxml2 2.9.6/lib/cmake*.

If LibXml2 was not installed to *C:/Program Files/libxml2 2.9.6/* you will need to adjust the path to match your situation.

Build
=====

Once the build scripts have been generated by CMake invoke the build with the appropriate command.  For Makefile based configurations the command is simply::

   make

If testing is enabled run the tests using the test target::

   make test

or using the ctest application::

   ctest

for a more verbose output run::

   ctest -V
